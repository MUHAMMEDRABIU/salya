## Goals

- **User Experience**: Deliver a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface for customers to browse, search, and order products.
- **Order Management**: Allow users to manage their cart, checkout, and track orders.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provide administrators with tools to manage products, users, orders, analytics, and system settings.
- **Security**: Implement input validation, XSS protection, and secure handling of sensitive data.
- **Scalability**: Organize code and assets for easy maintenance and future enhancements (e.g., payment integration, real-time tracking).

## Design & Technology

- **Frontend**:  
  - **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first styling and responsive design.
  - **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity (no frameworks or OOP in JS).
  - **Font Awesome** and custom SVGs/icons for visual cues.
  - **Modern UI Patterns**: Animated transitions, toast notifications, and mobile-first layouts.

- **Backend**:  
  - **PHP (Procedural)**: No OOP, functions organized in utility files.
  - **MySQL** (planned/future): For persistent storage of users, products, orders, etc.
  - **Session Management**: For cart and user authentication.

- **Directory Structure**:  
  - admin: Admin dashboard, analytics, settings, and utilities.
  - client: User-facing pages (dashboard, product, checkout, profile).
  - components, `partials/`: Shared PHP includes for headers, navbars, etc.
  - assets: Static files (JS, CSS, images).
  - `util/`: Reusable PHP and JS utility functions.
  - config, schema, tests: Configuration, database schema, and testing.

## Coding Style & Best Practices

- **No OOP**: Both PHP and JS avoid classes; logic is procedural and function-based.
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- **Reusable Utilities**: Shared logic placed in `util/` directories.
- **Security**: Input validation, XSS protection, and careful handling of user data.
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, logic, and data fetching are modular and separated.

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Integration**: Full CRUD for products, orders, and users.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and registration.
- **Payment Gateway**: Real payment processing.
- **Real-Time Features**: Order tracking, notifications.
- **Performance**: Image optimization, CDN usage, and efficient JS.
