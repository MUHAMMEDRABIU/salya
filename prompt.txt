I am working on a PHP-based project called "Frozen Foods," which facilitates ordering and delivery of frozen food products across Nigeria. I need assistance in creating a user dashboard with the following requirements:

### **Requirements**
1. **Design Framework**:
   - Use **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN) for styling.
   - HTML and Vanilla JavaScript for functionality.
   - Do not use React.js or any other frameworks.

2. **Dashboard Features**:
   - **Header**:
     - Include a menu button for toggling the sidebar.
     - Display a user profile icon with a gradient background and border.
   - **Search Bar**:
     - Add a search input field with a placeholder like "Search for chicken, fish, turkey..."
     - Include a search icon inside the input field.
   - **Tabs**:
     - Create tabs for filtering products (e.g., "All," "Chicken," "Fish," "Turkey").
     - Highlight the active tab with a dark background and white text.
   - **Product Grid**:
     - Display products in a responsive grid layout.
     - Each product card should include:
       - Product image.
       - Name, description, and price.
       - A favorite button with a heart icon.

3. **Functionality**:
   - Use Vanilla JavaScript for:
     - Sidebar toggle functionality.
     - Dynamic filtering of products based on selected tabs.
     - Search functionality to filter products by name.

4. **Styling**:
   - Ensure the design is responsive and visually appealing.
   - Use Tailwind CSS utilities for spacing, colors, and transitions.

### **Additional Notes**
- The project is PHP-based, but the dashboard should focus only on the frontend (HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JS).
- Avoid using React.js or any other frameworks.
- Avoid using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in both the PHP and JS for the implementation.
- All PHP files should be included in a `user` directory along with their corresponding stylesheets and scripts.
- Build utility functions for each feature (e.g., retrieving items, filtering, etc.) and place them in a `util` directory.

5. Extract the color palette from the main site:
   - Accent: #F97316
   - Gray: #f6f7fc
   - Dark: #201f20
   - Secondary: #ff7272
   - Font: 'DM Sans', sans-serif

6. Note the use of TailwindCSS utility classes for rapid UI development and consistency.

7. Maintain a cohesive look and feel with the main site, using the same color palette, typography, and spacing.

### **Your Goal**
- Help the user build a robust, visually consistent, and user-friendly user dashboard for Frozen Foods.
- Ensure all design and UX choices align with the main site's branding and philosophy.
- Organize the project structure effectively, ensuring all utility functions are reusable and placed in the `util` directory.

I am working on a PHP-based project called "Frozen Foods," which facilitates ordering and delivery of frozen food products across Nigeria. I need assistance in creating a product description page that matches the design provided in the attached image. The page should display the product details dynamically based on the retrieved `GET` ID. Below are the requirements:

### **Requirements**
1. **Design Framework**:
   - Use **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN) for styling.
   - HTML and Vanilla JavaScript for functionality.
   - Do not use React.js or any other frameworks.

2. **Page Features**:
   - **Header**:
     - Include a back button (arrow icon) to navigate to the previous page.
     - Display a notification icon with a badge indicating the number of notifications.
   - **Product Section**:
     - Display the product image prominently.
     - Include the product name, price, and quantity selector (with "+" and "-" buttons).
   - **Description Section**:
     - Show the product description in a clean and readable format.
     - Include a rating (e.g., 4.9) with a star icon.
   - **Action Buttons**:
     - Add two buttons:
       - "Order Now" (primary button with black background and white text).
       - "Add to Cart" (secondary button with white background and black border).

3. **Functionality**:
   - Use PHP to retrieve the product details dynamically based on the `GET` ID.
   - Use Vanilla JavaScript for:
     - Quantity increment and decrement functionality.
     - Handling button clicks (e.g., adding to cart or proceeding to order).
   - Ensure the page is responsive and works seamlessly across devices.

4. **Styling**:
   - Match the exact styling provided in the attached image:
     - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for spacing, colors, and transitions.
     - Ensure the design is clean, modern, and visually appealing.

5. **Additional Notes**:
   - The project is PHP-based, but the product description page should focus only on the frontend (HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JS).
